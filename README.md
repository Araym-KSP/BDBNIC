# BDBNIC - dev 
Skins and other bits for BDB 

Fixed by Araym for BDB dev version (only!!!) on KSP v.1.12.2. Derived from BDNIC developed by Drakenexh.

New Apollo capsule paints by Araym, for the upcoming Saturn/Apollo rework

Fixed Titan parts, after the Titan paint clean up

***IMPORTANT NOTES FOR INSTALL THIS PACKAGE***
- This is an "unofficial" and "under development" repository. It could have some issues, here and there, just because it is aiming to the actual dev-unreleased BDB, more than for the stable, release, but old, one (BDB v.1.8.1). If you are using THAT version, download BDBINC from Drakenexh's one.
- IF you are using BDB "master" dev version, you have probably still the old Apollo in your game. Remove eventually the entire "(your KPS install)/GameData/BDBINC/ApolloNew" folder, as could interfere with some B9PartSwitch aimed only to the BDB "apollo-saturn-revamp" dev.
- As the same, if you are using the BDB "apollo-saturn-revamp", there will be the possibility of other, different, B9PartSwitch errors, by the patches aimed to the old models of Apollo capsule (removed in the "apollo-saturn-revamp" version). Navigate to your KSP install, into : "(your KPS install)/GameData/BDBINC/Patches" and remove the "Apollo.cfg" file, that refers only to the old one. (Optionally you can also remove entirelly BDBINC textures for the old model too, that are in the "(your KPS install)/GameData/BDBINC/Apollo" folder)
